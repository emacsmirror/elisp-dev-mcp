* Overview

=elisp-dev-mcp= is an Emacs package that provides an MCP (Machine Code Protocol) server
for agentic Elisp development. It enables AI agents to assist with Elisp coding tasks
by providing a structured API to interact with Emacs and manipulate Elisp code.

This package leverages [[https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/mcp-server-lib.el][mcp-server-lib.el]] for the underlying MCP infrastructure.

* Installation

From MELPA:

=M-x package-install RET elisp-dev-mcp RET=

* Usage

** Registering with an MCP Client

After =mcp-server-lib= has been properly installed (including =M-x mcp-server-lib-install=), register =elisp-dev-mcp= with your MCP client:

#+begin_example
claude mcp add -s user -t stdio elisp-dev -- ~/.emacs.d/emacs-mcp-stdio.sh --init-function=elisp-dev-mcp-enable --stop-function=elisp-dev-mcp-disable
#+end_example

Before using the MCP server, you must start it in Emacs with =M-x mcp-server-lib-start=. Stop it with =M-x mcp-server-lib-stop= when done.

** Available MCP Handlers

*** Elisp Function Definition
- Name: =elisp-get-function-definition=
- Description: Get the source code definition of an Emacs Lisp function
- Parameters:
  - =function=: The name of the function to retrieve (string)
- Returns:
  - For Elisp functions:
    - =source=: The function's source code including header comments if present (string)
    - =file-path=: Path to the file where the function is defined (string)
    - =start-line=: First line number of the definition including header comments (1-based integer)
    - =end-line=: Last line number of the definition (1-based integer)

    - =function-name=: The name of the function (string)
    - =message=: A message indicating the function is implemented in C source code (string)

*** Elisp Variable Description
- Name: =elisp-describe-variable=

  - =value-type=: Type of the value (string, e.g. "cons", "string", "integer")
  - =documentation=: Variable documentation or null if none (string or null)
  - =source-file=: Path to the file where the variable is defined (string)
  - =is-custom=: Whether it's a customizable variable (boolean)
  - =custom-group=: The custom group this variable belongs to (string, only present for custom variables)
  - =custom-type=: The custom type specification (string, only present for custom variables)
  - =is-obsolete=: Whether the variable is marked obsolete (boolean)
  - =obsolete-since=: Version when the variable became obsolete (string, only present if obsolete)
  - =obsolete-replacement=: Suggested replacement for the obsolete variable (string, only present if obsolete)
  - =is-alias=: Whether the variable is an alias for another variable (boolean)
  - =alias-target=: The variable this is an alias for (string, only present if alias)
  - =is-special=: Whether the variable is a special (dynamically scoped) variable (boolean)
  - or =error=: Error message if something went wrong (string)

*** Elisp Info Documentation Lookup
- Name: =elisp-info-lookup-symbol=
- Description: Look up Elisp symbols in Info documentation and return the complete documentation node
- Parameters:
  - =symbol=: The Elisp symbol to look up (string)
- Returns:
  - =found=: Whether documentation was found (boolean)
  - =symbol=: The symbol that was looked up (string)
  - =node=: The Info node name containing the documentation (string, when found)
  - =manual=: The Info manual name, typically 'elisp' (string, when found)
  - =content=: The complete Info node content including all examples, cross-references, and related information (string, when found)
  - =info-ref=: Info reference like '(elisp)Node Name' for direct access (string, when found)
  - =message=: Error or not-found message (string, when not found)

*** Elisp Source File Reader
- Name: =elisp-read-source-file=
- Description: Read Elisp source files from Emacs system directories or ELPA packages
- Parameters:
  - =file-path=: Absolute path to =.el= file (string)
- Returns:
  - The complete file contents as a string
  - or =error=: Error message if file not found, invalid format, or access denied (string)
- Examples:
  - ="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-mac/emacs-29.1-mac-10.0/share/emacs/29.1/lisp/files.el"= - Read system file
  - ="/Users/name/.emacs.d/elpa/package-1.0/package.el"= - Read ELPA package
- Security:
  - Only reads from Emacs system lisp directories and =~/.emacs.d/elpa/=
  - Rejects paths with =..= traversal
  - Resolves symlinks to prevent escaping allowed directories
- Features:
  - Transparently handles =.el.gz= compressed files
  - Works directly with paths from =elisp-get-function-definition=
  - Returns complete file contents as string
