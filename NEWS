* elisp-dev-mcp 1.1.1 (unreleased)

** Bug fixes

*** elisp-get-function-definition now handles compressed source files
The tool now checks for ~.el.gz~ files when the ~.el~ file doesn't exist,
mirroring the logic already present in ~elisp-read-source-file~. This fixes
retrieval of function definitions from compressed Emacs system files.

* elisp-dev-mcp 1.1.0 (2026-01-02)

** Bug fixes

*** elisp-read-source-file now uses standard package variables
The tool now checks ~package-user-dir~ and ~package-directory-list~ instead of
hardcoding ~/elpa/~ paths. This improves compatibility with different Emacs
configurations and package managers like Eask.

** New features

*** Configurable additional allowed directories for elisp-read-source-file
Added ~elisp-dev-mcp-additional-allowed-dirs~ custom variable to allow users
of alternative package managers (straight.el, elpaca, etc.) to configure
additional directories that ~elisp-read-source-file~ can access. The feature
maintains security through path normalization and validation while extending
functionality for custom package setups.
