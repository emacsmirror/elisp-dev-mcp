;;; Commentary:

;; Test fixture functions that will be byte-compiled for testing the
;; elisp-dev-mcp package.  These functions are used to verify that MCP
;; tools work correctly with byte-compiled code.  Some functions
;; intentionally lack documentation for testing purposes.

;;; Code:

;; Header comment for byte-compiled function
;; This should be preserved in the function definition
(defun elisp-dev-mcp-bytecode-test--with-header (x y)
  "A byte-compiled function with header comment.
X and Y are numbers to be added."
